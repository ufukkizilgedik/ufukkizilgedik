## Introduction

The Dev Hoh, not to be confused with DEV-HÃ–H (People's Liberation Movement / Revolutionary), is a sudden breeze of warm air from an unidentified source, which is widely attributed to a giant's exhaling. Emerging in coldest urban environments, such as the often avoided corner table of a Gayrettepe bar, the Dev Hoh is a mysterious atmospheric change leading to a temporary increase in local temperature that is readily welcome by the people in its impact area, who lack the foresightedness of dressing for the cold weather.

The Dev Hoh is marked for its unpredictability. That is neither its origins nor its timings could be easily deciphered by ordinary minds, begetting a myriad of, mostly nonsensical, theories, speculations, and even cults that interpret the incident to be a "divine intervention". Ontological studies around the phenomenon suggest that it is only knowable through its affect and lack of evidence for its material existence unavoidably makes it a subject of philosophy and theology as opposed to scientific endeavor. Nonetheless, such debates remain mostly inconclusive.

## Effects

The Dev Hoh is known for causing a swift change of mood in its surroundings. People in the Dev Hoh impacted areas are observed to half open their mouths revealing a barely recognizable smile in feelings of numbed comfort, and, when the initial shock is diminished and logic kicks back in, search with their incredulous eyes whereabouts the hot air is coming from, in a futile, almost pathetic effort.

A number of interviews with known witnesses proved that the most common reaction to this wave of hot air is to look around for the heaters mounted on the exterior walls of the open areas in cafes and bars that are usually allocated for smokers. Due to the recent global economic downturn, such heaters are employed less and less and turned off even if available. Disuse of heaters aggravated the notion that there has to be something "supernatural" behind the Dev Hoh.

## Explanations

Aside from the pseudo-scientific claims that periodically surface and keep the public interest on the subject alive, scientific community at large, social scientists, psychologists, and other public intellectuals delivered some rigorous attempts to unravel the mysteries of the phenomenon, albeit no substantial progress could be made. 

### Scientific Explanations

While scientific approaches to the causes and origins of Dev Hoh vary extensively, the dominant view finds global warming culpable. In a recent article published in _Nature_, proponents of this view argued that global warming's impact should not be examined solely at a macro-level. Instead, micro-level aberrations, such as the Dev Hoh, can and should also be attributed to global warming. Dr. Itzigsohn, the president of _Scientists for Research on Dev Hoh_ (SRDH), summarized their point of view saying, "_When talking about global warming, people often think of rising ocean levels and melting icebergs and shit like that. This could not have been further away from truth. The levels of global warming that we encounter today brings along with it countless tiny environmental alterations that humanity has previously not experienced. This is news to everyone including the scientific community, and we agree we are still in infancy when it comes to fully grasping the forces of nature that create the Dev Hoh, but I firmly believe it is NOT something beyond explanation through scientific means._"

### Biological Explanations

Moving from the fact that 99 percent of all recorded Dev Hoh incidents in history actually happened in ass-cheek-freezingly-cold bars full of intoxicated people, some biologists and psychologists suggested that the Dev Hoh is actually human body and mind's cooperation to generate a false sense of warmth to overcome freezing, under the effect of serious levels of alcohol. However, this theory has come under harsh criticism as a series of natural experiments replicating the said conditions did not produce a Dev Hoh, no matter how cold the environment was and how drunk the people were.

### Societal Explanations

Sociological explanations of the Dev Huh focus primarily social actors' adaptability to unfavorable conditions through strategic and communal action. Observing that the event occurs under the conditions when alcohol consumption is at its highest, conversational noise is the loudest, and the night is the coldest, the theory claims that people collectively release their long-kept-inside farts, believing in their intoxicated state that it would not be heard, which in turn condense and multiply in an enclosed environment to hit bystanders in the form a strong heat-wave. While this theory gives somewhat of an explanation as to why people put on a face of relief in times of the Dev Huh (as they just farted), it tends to neglect the odorless nature of the phenomenon.
